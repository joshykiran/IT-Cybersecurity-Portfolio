# Kiran Joshy — IT & Cyber Security Portfolio

Aspiring **Cloud & Cybersecurity Professional** with hands-on experience designing, securing, monitoring, and automating Microsoft-based cloud environments.

I focus on **practical, operations-driven security**, spanning identity protection, endpoint and email security, centralized logging, threat detection, threat intelligence, and automated incident response.  
My portfolio is structured to reflect **real-world enterprise and SOC workflows**, prioritizing security fundamentals, clarity, and operational readiness over isolated lab exercises.

### 🧪 Project 02 — Advanced Azure Sentinel SOC Lab (Detection + TI + Automation)
A SOC-focused lab built to simulate realistic Sentinel workflows across **ingestion, detection engineering, investigation, hunting, allowlisting, automation, and threat intelligence operations**.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- Deployed Microsoft Sentinel Training Lab with realistic pre-ingested security data
- Enabled and validated key data connectors (Azure Activity, Defender products, Threat Intelligence)
- Built and tuned analytics rules (template-based + custom scheduled queries)
- Incident triage workflows (ownership, investigation, evidence review, and closure)
- Geo-IP enrichment playbooks + workbook-driven validation
- Threat hunting (Solorigate) with bookmarks promoted to incident evidence
- Watchlists for allowlisting (PenTest IPs) and rule tuning to reduce false positives
- Threat Intelligence operations (IOC ingestion, manual IOC lifecycle, workbook enhancement)

📌 **Technologies Used:**  
Microsoft Sentinel · Log Analytics · KQL · MDTI · Playbooks · Automation Rules · Workbooks · Watchlists
