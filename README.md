# Kiran Joshy — IT & Cyber Security Portfolio

Aspiring **Cloud & Cybersecurity Professional** with hands-on experience designing, securing, monitoring, and automating Microsoft-based cloud environments.

I specialize in **practical security operations**—from identity protection and endpoint security to centralized logging, threat detection, and automated incident response.  
My projects are intentionally built to reflect **real-world enterprise and SOC workflows**, emphasizing clarity, security best practices, and operational thinking rather than isolated lab tasks.
