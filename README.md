**What this project demonstrates:**
- Built a secure Microsoft 365 tenant and identity foundation
- Enforced identity-first access controls using Conditional Access and MFA
- Implemented endpoint and mobile protection using Intune and Microsoft Defender
- Centralized logging and detection using Microsoft Sentinel
- Investigated and analyzed real-world **RDP brute-force attack telemetry**
- Enhanced incident context using GeoIP enrichment and attack visualization
- Automated response workflows using SOAR (Logic Apps & Runbooks)
- Provisioned and deployed infrastructure using Terraform (IaC)

📌 **Technologies Used:**  
Azure · Microsoft 365 · Entra ID · Intune · Defender XDR · Sentinel · Terraform · Cloudflare

### 🧪 Project 02 — Advanced Microsoft Sentinel SOC Lab (Detection + TI + Automation)
A SOC-focused lab simulating realistic Microsoft Sentinel workflows across **ingestion, detection engineering, investigation, hunting, allowlisting, automation, and threat intelligence operations**.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- Deployed Microsoft Sentinel Training Lab with realistic pre-ingested security data
- Enabled and validated key connectors (Azure Activity, Defender products, Threat Intelligence)
- Built and tuned analytics rules (template-based + custom scheduled query detections)
- Executed incident triage workflows (ownership, investigation, evidence review, closure)
- Enriched incidents using playbooks and workbook-driven investigation
- Performed threat hunting (Solorigate) and promoted bookmarks into incident evidence
- Reduced false positives using watchlists (PenTest IP allowlisting) and rule tuning
- Managed Threat Intelligence workflows (IOC ingestion, manual IOC lifecycle, workbook enhancement)

📌 **Technologies Used:**  
Microsoft Sentinel · Log Analytics · KQL · MDTI · Playbooks · Automation Rules · Workbooks · Watchlists
